Remarks on card text:

Heimdall: +6 with Bifrost -> card reference formatting inconsistent
Worthy: .. with Power greater than 12 -> .. with base power greater than 12?

Card interaction / timing questions:

* What's the timing of Rogue (may copy the base power and one tag of another HERO in your hand)?
  What if the targeted HERO is blanked (before/after depending on the timing)
* Berserk (Choose a HERO or ALLY. -3 for each OTHER HERO or ALLY and each URBAN)
  -> choosing a HERO or ALLY is purely thematical, right? It doesn't affect scoring in any way.
